# LinkedIn Search Script

The script allows the use to define filter parameters to search for jobs in LinkedIN (**job titles, companies, location, on-site/remote, experience level and time filter**).

The user defines the filter parameters in the main.py file. After running the script, a link is generated by taking into consideration the LinkedIN boolean search terms to include and exclude keywords from the job search (ex. excluding a company). 
The link is autmatically opened by the default web browser, containing the defined search terms.
