# LinkedIn Job Filter

The script allows the user to define filter parameters to search for jobs on LinkedIn (**job titles, companies, location, on-site/remote, experience level, and time filter**).

The user defines the filter parameters in the main.py file. After running the script, a link is generated by considering LinkedIn boolean search terms to include and exclude keywords from the job search (ex. excluding a company, filtering by cities). 
The script calls the default web browser and uses the generated link, which will open the LinkedIn website with the defined search terms.
